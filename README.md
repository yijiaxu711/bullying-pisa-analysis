## 4. The Awakening of Womenâ€™s Consciousness and Fertility Behavior in China

- **Dataset**: Literature review and national fertility statistics (UN, NBS, scholarly sources)  
- **Focus**: This project explores how rising gender consciousness among Chinese women influences fertility intentions and resistance to state-led pronatalist policies. It situates the issue within broader trends of educational attainment, delayed marriage, and shifting gender norms.  
- **Framework**: Guided by the **Second Demographic Transition (SDT)** and **Gender Revolution Theory**, the study synthesizes both Chinese- and English-language academic literature to examine how personal autonomy and structural inequality intersect.  
- **Key Insight**: Many women are not only delaying childbirth but actively rejecting traditional family roles, signaling a conscious pushback against unequal gender expectations.  
- **Policy Relevance**: Highlights the need for fertility policies that go beyond economic incentives and address **structural gender inequality**, reproductive autonomy, and work-life balance to truly support womenâ€™s choices.
