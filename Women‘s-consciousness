## 📌 Overview

This project investigates:
- Declining fertility in China amid cultural, institutional, and ideological shifts
- Application of **Second Demographic Transition (SDT)** theory
- The impact of **gender equality**, women's education, and workforce participation
- Real-world resistance against traditional norms and policy implications

## 🧠 Theoretical Frameworks

- 📘 **Second Demographic Transition** – Shift from traditional family formation to individualistic values and self-realization.
- ♀️ **Gender Revolution Theory** – Dual-phase transformation in gender roles: from entry into the labor market to domestic role rebalancing.

## 📊 Methods & Data

- Qualitative synthesis of existing Chinese demographic research
- Thematic analysis of:
  - Fertility intentions
  - Marriage delay
  - Women's autonomy
- No primary dataset; relies on secondary scholarly sources (e.g., Lesthaeghe, Raymo, Yu & Xie)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Rise of educated, unmarried women** (the “leftover women” phenomenon)
- **Low fertility intention** despite family planning relaxation
- **Institutional pressure** still favors traditional gender roles
- **Policy suggestions**: Emphasize work-family balance, shift from control to support
